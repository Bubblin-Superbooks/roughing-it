<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Moral.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">If the reader thinks he is done, now, and that this book has no moral to it, he is in error. The moral of it is this: If you are of any account, stay at home and make your way by faithful diligence; but if you are “no account,” go away from home, and then you will have to work, whether you want to or not. Thus you become a blessing to your friends by ceasing to be a nuisance to them—if the people you go among suffer by the operation.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "0%" src="570.jpg" url = "570.jpg" /><hr class="section"></div> </div>
