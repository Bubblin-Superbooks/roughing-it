This reminiscence calls to mind Jim Townsend’s tunnel. He had paid assessments on a mine called the “Daley” till he was well-nigh penniless. Finally an assessment was levied to run a tunnel two hundred and fifty feet on the Daley, and Townsend went up on the hill to look into matters.</p><p>He found the Daley cropping out of the apex of an exceedingly sharp- pointed peak, and a couple of men up there “facing” the proposed tunnel. Townsend made a calculation. Then he said to the men:</p><p>“So you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred and fifty feet to strike this ledge?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Well, do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and arduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man?”</p></div> </div>
