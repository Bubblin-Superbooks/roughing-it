<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter XXXII.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">We seemed to be in a road, but that was no proof. We tested this by walking off in various directionsâ€”the regular snow-mounds and the regular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the true road, and that the others had found only false ones. Plainly the situation was desperate. We were cold and stiff and the horses were tired. We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning. This was wise, because if we were wandering from the right road and the snow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to hopeless if we kept on.</p></div> </div>
