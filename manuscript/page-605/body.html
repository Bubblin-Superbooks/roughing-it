A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most wanton and cold-blooded way. Of course the papers were full of it, and all men capable of reading, read about it. And of course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it. A jury-list was made out, and Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned precisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America:</p><p>“Have you heard of this homicide?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Have you held conversations upon the subject?”</p></div> </div>
